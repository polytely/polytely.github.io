                    <h1>Exploring and implementing interesting ideas</h1>
					<p>There are no algorithms that are enough by themselves to deliver an impactful solution.
					In fact, the number and diversity of the algorithms published in literature is so 
					large that the main challenge is to select the most suitable few for the problem at 
					hand each time. What is challenging is the scaling of these techniques into massive 
					datasets and corporate clusters or the cloud. Based on our experience, a fully 
					functional architecture to collect, store and analyze data can be built out of 
					readily available open-source technologies. Consequently, the objective in each case 
					concerns the full integration with the variety of data sources, and the performance 
					evaluation of the solution, since the main challenge in an eventual production-grade 
					roll-out is dimensioning.</p>
					<p>At the same time, different algorithms can handle well differently structured data. 
					In fact, probably the most important aspect of an algorithm is the data structure that it is 
					most effective to deal with. We aim to publish our code and explorations while implementing 
					some interesting algorithms and testing their scalability (perform incrementally and perform 
					parallel), robustness to noise (real data have significant noise even if there is a 
					good theory to explain its generating process) and the structure of the data that 
					can break them.</p>

                    <h1>Regression Trees for policy assessment</h1>
					<p>We are in the process of building an open source decision support system that leverages the availability of public domain 
					   data, so as to provide insights on the dynamics that govern a national power market. In particular, we want to provide the 
					   functionality to collect, transform and analyze power market data, as well as to visualize the monetary flows between the 
					   relevant market actors. Data analysis aims at factor attribution; we can observe what actually happened in a given power 
					   market but we also want to understand which factors were the most influential, as well as the direction of their influence.</p>
					<p>Furthermore, one way to perceive a power market is as a network of actors connected through transactions and monetary flows. 
					   Understanding and visualizing these monetary flows can contribute significantly to the assessment of the policy interventions 
					   in the market, particularly when one wants to explore the possible conflicts or alliances between the involved actors if the 
					   system’s state would change due to either the effectuation of a policy measure or a shift in the external drivers of the 
					   system. The main premise is that by identifying conditions of conflicting interests between the involved actors, one can 
					   devise a roadmap of least resistance for a policy measure to attain its goals.</p>
					<p>The task of data analysis will be based on recursive partitioning and regression trees. In more details:</p>
					<div id="list4">
					<ol>
						<li><p>The point of departure of the implementation is the RETIS tree-based regression approach <a style="color:blue" href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.35.2878">(Karali, 1992)</a>, 
						    which uses linear regression models in the tree leaves. RETIS evaluates a split by building a multiple linear model 
							for each subset and computing its residual variance.</p></li> 
						<li><p>Due to the existence of multicollinearity in the variables describing, ridge regression will be employed as a 
						    model for each mode. There are computational shortcuts - e.g. <a style="color:blue" href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.3570.pdf ">
							(Pahikkala, Airola and Salakoski, 2010)</a> - that permit fast updating of the models' coefficients when adding new or removing 
							existing data.</p></li>
						<li><p>Including a new feature in a node’s probabilistic model and splitting a node’s data by adding a new rule are very similar tasks under a 
						    feature selection perspective. Consequently, at each node the algorithm chooses either to include an additional feature or include a 
							new splitting rule. <a style="color:blue" href=" http://jmlr.org/papers/v7/zhou06a.html">Streamwise Feature Selection</a> will be 
							employed to regulate the tree development.</p></li>
						<li><p>The algorithm will actively track concept drift in the data. Concept drift cannot be avoided for complex phenomena that are 
						    not governed by fixed laws of nature. All processes that arise from human activity, such as socioeconomic processes, and 
							biological processes are likely to experience concept drift. At the same time, the trend contains information that we don’t 
							want to lose. We are interested in finding what actually drives the trend in the data or, equivalently if there is a stable 
							long-run relationship between some of the data.</p>
							<p>The important idea here is that non-stationarity is not a problem of the data, but a problem of the methods that are sometimes 
							   used for its analysis and which have a hard time distinguishing between the next two cases:</p>
							   <ul>
							   <li><p>Two processes are dependent because changes in the one are reflected in changes in the other.</p></li>
                               <li><p>Two processes have similar (opposite) trends, and naturally higher values of the first one are paired with 
							       higher (lower) values of the other.</p></li>
							   </ul>
							<p>At the same time, there are cases where we want to separate the long-run trend from the short-run dynamics of a 
							   system. As an example, the spot (hub) natural gas price can be decomposed into:<p>
							    <div class="row-fluid">
								<div class="span8">
									<ol>
									<li><p>A long-run trend that is inevitably associated with the long-run evolution of the natural gas production and distribution costs, as well as the price evolution of potential substitutes (mainly coal).</p></li>
									<li><p>A seasonal spread in the price that is associated with weather and economic activity seasonality, as well as the available total storage capacity.</p></li>
									<li><p>The short-run deviations that are driven by deviations in the expected (based on the previous years’ experience) conditions in demand and supply.</p></li>
									</ol>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
										<a href="styles/ngas.png"> <img height=50 src="styles/ngas.png"></a>
								</div>
								</div>
							<p>This conceptual model of the natural gas price reflects an interesting approach; rather than identifying and removing 
							   the trend, one could track a relationship between the trends of the variables. What is left can be assumed to be the 
							   short-run dynamics.</p>
						</li>
