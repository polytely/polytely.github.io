                    <h1>The role of data analytics in creating energy efficiency services</h1>
                    <p>Big Data is a term consistently found in articles and solutions concerning energy efficiency, 
					the premise being that smart meters – and smart grids in general – are able to collect and make 
					available large volumes of data, the analysis of which can help identify relationships that 
					were previously unnoticed, improve predictability and facilitate new services of information 
					provision. Although this premise is generally true, it helps if we have already defined the questions that our 
					data analytics algorithms should be able to address. In Polytely, we are focusing on two challenges 
					that are critical, according to our way of perceiving the energy efficiency services to provide.</p>
					
					<p>The first challenge is to extract of set of recurring patterns in a stream 
					of energy consumption data from a large number of households, so as to perform <u>meaningful</u> 
					clustering of these households. Contrary to the aggregated load curves which are characterized by their seasonality,
					regularity and sensitivity to meteorological conditions, household load curves are very volatile, 
					their shape depends mainly on the consumer behaviour and are less dependent on weather conditions. 
					Consequently, our focus is on identifying and exploiting common consumption behaviour patterns in 
					a load profiles stream.</p>

					<a class="pull-right" href="styles/discovery.png">
					<img class="thumbnail" src="styles/discovery.png" alt="Discovering patterns" style="height:200px;">
					</a>
					<div class="media-body"><p class="media-heading">In reality, this is a feature extraction problem and in this context 
					meaningful clustering implies the ability to associate recurring patterns in consumption with actual 
					practices in the consumers's daily routines. Intelligent efficiency is largely based on the premise that 
					clustering by recurrent patterns will lead to results that are significantly similar to the actual 
					segmentation of the consumers based on their habits and characteristics.</p>
					</div>
					</div>
					<p>The second challenge concerns the estimation of the willingness or capability of the consumers to 
					adapt their consumption profiles in response to external recommendations. One way to approach this 
					issue is as if each consumer can be represented by one model that generates a load profile segment 
					based on the load profile segment’s class during the previous time interval and by another model that 
					generates deviations in this load profile as a response to a recommendation received.</p>

                    <h1>Exploring and implementing interesting ideas</h1>
					<p>There are no algorithms that are enough by themselves to deliver an impactful solution.
					In fact, the number and diversity of the algorithms published in literature is so 
					large that the main challenge is to select the most suitable few for the problem at 
					hand each time. What is challenging is the scaling of these techniques into massive 
					datasets and corporate clusters or the cloud. Based on our experience, a fully 
					functional architecture to collect, store and analyze data can be built out of 
					readily available open-source technologies. Consequently, the objective in each case 
					concerns the full integration with the variety of data sources, and the performance 
					evaluation of the solution, since the main challenge in an eventual production-grade 
					roll-out is dimensioning.</p>
					<p>At the same time, different algorithms can handle well differently structured data. 
					In fact, probably the most important aspect of an algorithm is the data structure that it is 
					most effective to deal with. We aim to publish our code and explorations while implementing 
					some interesting algorithms and testing their scalability (perform incrementally and perform 
					parallel), robustness to noise (real data have significant noise even if there is a 
					good theory to explain its generating process) and the structure of the data that 
					can break them.</p>

                    <h1>Regression Trees</h1>
					<p>One of the first algorithms to implement is the well-known regression trees. 
					   Although not a good tool for predictive modeling (mainly due to the lack of a 
					   principled probabilistic framework), trees are a good solution for exploring data 
					   and facilitating its visualization. Here, we aim to develop a useful 
					   implementation.</p>
