                    <h1>Using data analytics to support Automated Demand Response</h1>
					<p>Demand Response programs aim for changes in daily electric usage – relatively to the 
					   consumers’ normal consumption patterns – in response to changes in the price of electricity 
					   over time or to incentive payments designed to induce lower electricity use at times of 
					   high wholesale market prices or when system reliability is jeopardized.</p>
					<p>Demand response can be provided by consumers through:</p>
				</div>
			</div>
				
				<div class="row-fluid">
				<div class="span8">
					<ul class="list3">
					<li><p>Shifting consumption to other time periods (load shifting);</p></li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="span4">
						<img src="styles/shifting.png" class="img-responsive"/>
				</div>
				</div>	
					
				<div class="row-fluid">
				<div class="span8">
					<ul class="list3">
					<li><p>Reducing or interrupting consumption (curtailment) or utilizing on-site generation in place of power from the grid (consumption of self-generated electricity).</p></li>
					</ul>
				</div>
					<div class="span4">
						<img src="styles/reducing.png" class="img-responsive"/>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span12">
					<p>Under a static perspective, consumers state or program their demand response 
					   flexibility as a set of constraints, and an energy management system aims to 
					   optimize the demand, storage and in-house generation with respect to these 
					   constraints. This is a stochastic dynamic optimization problem; the energy 
					   management system must repeatedly make decisions using estimations of the 
					   future states. If consumers have a volatile day-to-day schedule for their 
					   activities, one would expect that they either choose to devote time to 
					   systematically re-program their flexibility or choose their flexibility levels 
					   to adhere to the minimum ones that cover this volatility.</p>
					<p>The <a style="color:blue " href="http://www.mirabel-project.eu/">MIRABEL EU project</a> 
					  (Micro-Request-Based Aggregation, Forecasting and Scheduling of Energy Demand, 
					  Supply and Distribution) project was based on the concept of explicitly flexible 
					  demand and supply on the household level, encapsulated into flexibility objects 
					  (flex-objects). The concept of the flex-objects, as well as the algorithms 
					  developed by MIRABEL for aggregating, disaggregating and forecasting flex-objects, 
					  can be of high value when designing a demand response solution.</p>
					<p>Under a more dynamic perspective, the interactions between occupant behavior, the 
					   weather, energy efficiency improvements and on-site generation capabilities should 
					   be tracked and understood, and the coordination between supply, demand and storage 
					   should be optimized accordingly.In this problem, data analytics do not aim to 
					   solve the optimization problem. One could use linear quadratic optimal control, 
					   $l_1$ regularization of the control law so that to create sparsity and, as a 
					   result, support decentralization, or a variant of reinforcement learning of the 
					   policy function. Data analytics stands between the real system and the controller 
					   and provides a function of summarizing the inputs into a reduced set of meaningful 
					   features and patterns with high predictive power.</p>
					<p>In practical terms, data analytics can help simplify the function $g(\cdot)$ in the 
					   general formulation of optimal control, by simplifying the representation of states $x(t)$
					   and by helping define the way a control decision $u(t)$ affects the expected state.</p>
					  <span lang="latex">x(t+1) = g(x(t), u(t))</span>
					  <p>s.t.</p>
					  <span lang="latex"> h(x(t), u(t))\leq0</span>
					 <p>A common approach in literature for supply, demand and storage coordination is based 
					    on the use of agent models. The rationale is that agent models provide for horizontal 
						scaling, adaptability to consumer preferences or routines and privacy preservation. 
						The downside is that the corresponding models rely on a market-based control scheme, 
						which requires the simulation of a virtual day-ahead and intra-day market. The 'big 
						data' technologies (see <a style="color:blue" href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a>
						or <a style="color:blue" href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a>) also provide for horizontal scalability. 
						Ever more, a great number of machine learning algorithms are formulated as loss function 
						minimization problems, something that involves repeatedly executing update equations.
						This brings adaptability to changing conditions. Concept Drift Adaptation approaches can 
						enhance further the ability to flexibly react to such changes.</p>
						<p>Analysing big data in a privacy-preserving fashion has been the focus of much 
						   on-going research. For example, the  EU FP7 project <a style="color:blue" href="http://axleproject.eu/">AXLE</a>
						   (Advanced Analytics for Extremely Large European Databases) focuses on large-scale analytics 
						   on real-world datasets that include clinical data, while addressing the requirements of 
						   quality, privacy, security and auditability.</p>	
						<p>Automated demand response does not exclude providing consumers with feedback. On the 
						   contrary, if demand response aims at improving sufficiency and best use of available 
						   resources, consumers should be able to see how their actions contribute to the attainment 
						   of this goal. We are experimenting with approximations of the <a style="color:blue" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value">
						   Shapley Value</a> that learn it by associating the past actions of the consumers with the results at the 
						   aggregate level. The Shapley Value is the mean marginal contribution of each participant in a particular demand response scheme to all 
						   possible coalitions of the other participants.</p>
