                    <h1>Efficiency Oriented Energy Consumer Collaboration</h1>
					<p>Our basic principle is that intelligent energy efficiency is more about social 
					   innovations and technologies that enable their emergence and diffusion, and less 
					   about sensing and data analytics.  One reason to start from this assumption is that 
					   social interactions and networks can create and evolve new ideas and new ways of 
					   doing things that have a higher rate of survival than ideas and products that are 
					   based on predefined perceptions of what people would or should do.</p>
					<p>The second reason stems from the very nature of the transition towards a 
					   low-carbon energy system. Leaving aside the need for clean and flexible central 
					   supply, the utilization of decentralized and renewable-based generation is viable 
					   under a paradigm of local coordination of different capabilities (generation, 
					   efficient consumption and storage) with the aim of local energy sufficiency.</p>
					   <div class="media">
					   <a class="pull-left" href="styles/community.jpg">
					<img class="thumbnail" src="styles/community.jpg" alt="Community" style="height:200px;">
					</a>
					<div class="media-body"><p class="media-heading">An energy community is a highly diverse set of consumers with varying capabilities; there are 
					   consumers that want to reduce energy consumption and costs, consumers with micro-generation 
					   capacity, even consumers with combined heat and power systems, which in combination with thermal 
					   storage, allow a time-flexible operation. This heterogeneity in capabilities is a strong driver for 
					   the community to evolve through interactions and experience sharing. It is interesting 
					   that this view of how an energy community can be defined mirrors the concept of 
					   <i>microgrids</i>. Microgrids achieve specific local goals, such as reliability, carbon emission 
					   reduction, diversification of energy sources, and cost reduction, established by the 
					   community being served.</p>
					</div>
					</div>
					<p></p>
					<p>We aim to develop the necessary 
					infrastructure to perform scalable, adaptive learning of the consuming behaviour, 
					efficiency improvements and generation capabilities 
					of <i>smart energy community</i> members that collaborate to ensure quality of energy 
					supply and environment preservation. The reason why we aim to explore the issue of 
					consumer participation in the energy system transition by focusing on community formation 
					is that while our behaviour in relation to energy consumption/prosumption and energy 
					efficiency is affected by a series of interrelated factors, the creation and 
					mobilization of communities around a shared 
					goal, can affect a significant number of these factors.</p>
					<p>In this context, 'learning' aims to understand and provide guidance, rather than 
					forecasting.  The notion of identifying inefficiencies by comparing the consumers’ 
					profiles with the average profile of the cluster they belong to and the provision 
					of recommendations based on changes that similar consumers were able to make, 
					capitalize on the collaborative filtering concept in personalized recommendations 
					systems. The basic idea of these systems can be described using the personalized 
					recommendations generated by online bookstores: if users shared the same interests 
					in the past – if they viewed or bought the same books, for instance – they will also 
					have similar tastes in the future. The “collaborative filtering” name stems from the 
					fact that the selection of hopefully interesting books involves filtering the most 
					promising ones from a large set and that the users implicitly collaborate with one 
					another.</p>
					<p>In practice, clear-cut cluster structures are not the norm; there are consumers 
					that could belong to more than one cluster. In this case, these consumers could be 
					regarded as very efficient when compared to the average members of one cluster and 
					very inefficient when compared to the average members of another. The recommendations 
					functionality will capitalize on this reality, so that to always compare a consumer 
					to the average one in the cluster where the consumer can be regarded as inefficient.</p>
