				<p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.5em">Polytely Analytics organises and implements workshops, during which the participants engage in a 
				participatory roadmapping process that aims to identify strategic pathways and opportunities for 
				collaboration and innovation. The roadmapping process facilitates the exchange of local or sectoral 
				knowledge and experience, and highlights opportunities for and challenges of collaboration between the 
				involved stakeholders. It is also expected that opportunities for collaboration will emerge through the 
				identification of the conditions under which stakeholders' collaboration could increase their capability to 
				affect the future rather than submit to it.</p>
				
				<p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.5em">The main purpose of this process is not to come up with scenarios; the process's goal is to identify patterns
				of potential collaboration or conflict between the stakeholders. The main question for the participants under a 
				given scenario is:</p>
					<blockquote>Given your expectations of your (i.e. the stakeholders you represent) and the other 
					stakeholders' actions under this scenario, what would be the benefit of collaboration, around which 
					technology and/or service could this collaboration materialise, and what measures should be 
					implemented - in terms of learning, experimenting or risk sharing - so that collaboration to be viable?</blockquote>  

				<p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.5em">The participatory roadmapping process:
					<ol style="font-size:14px; text-align: justify">
					<li>Brings forth the knowledge and concerns of the stakeholders.</li>
					<li>Adopts a <i>stakeholder based</i> approach that views the future system under study as the outcome 
					of the interactions of the stakeholders who operate within it.</li>
					<li>Facilitate the exchange of local knowledge and experience, and highlight opportunities 
					for and challenges of collaboration between the involved stakeholders.</li>
					</ol></p>

					<p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.5em">The outcome of this process is a shared - among the participating stakeholders - map of interrelations 
					and links that connect stakeholders around services or technologies.  Depending of the details of the 
					methodology and its adaptation each time, these maps can exist in software, in printed handouts filled in 
					by the participants or even photos of graphs and diagrams in a room with full-wall whiteboards.</p>
					
					<p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.5em">Some tools we use:
						<ol style="font-size:14px; text-align: justify">
							<li>Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM): A cognitive map can be described as a qualitative model of how a 
							    given system operates. The map is based on defined variables and the causal relationships 
								between these variables. The variables can be physical quantities that can be measured or 
								complex aggregate and abstract ideas, such as political forces or goals. An FCM is 
								essentially an extension of a cognitive map. It is a weighted, directed graph representing 
								the perceived causal structure of a system. One can include actors, objectives or matters of 
								concern, technologies or infrastructure and driving forces in these diagrams, which can be 
								directly transformed into simple mathematical models to be interrogated by the participants.</li><br>
							<li>Cross-impact balance analysis (CIB) is a consistent scenario development method that promotes 
							    understanding of the system through an accompanying reflective process. Due to the fact that the 
								method can be substantiated using a system-theoretical background, it can be utilized in combination 
								with FCM.</li><br>
							<li>Adaptation Pathways provide insight into the sequencing of actions over time, potential lock-ins, 
							and path dependencies.  A notion central to the Adaptation Pathways is the one of adaption tipping points 
							that corresponds to the conditions under which an action no longer meets the specified objectives. 
							After reaching a tipping point, additional actions are needed. As a result, a pathway emerges. 
							The Adaptation Pathways approach presents a sequence of possible actions after a tipping point in 
							the form of adaptation trees that represent alternative routes to get to the same desired point in 
							the future. We visualize these pathways using the Subway Map Metaphor.</li>
						</ol></p>
					<p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.5em">The framework shaping our roadmapping exercises is derived from our conscious avoidance of the following misconceptions:</p>
						<ol style="font-size:14px; text-align: justify">
							<li>Complex systems can be fully understood and described</li>
							<li>Uncertainty is always reducible or quantifiable</li>
							<li>Simple cause-effect relationships can always be established</li>
							<li>A  complex  system  must  be  fully  understood  before making decisions that affect it 
							(positively or negatively)</li>
							<li>With  enough  effort  and  knowledge,  complex  systems  are fully controllable</li>
							<li>A decision is the end-point of a linear process of reasoning which includes neutral 
							weighting of pros and cons, and optimization.</li>
