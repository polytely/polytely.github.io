                    <h1>Real time coordination of energy demand, storage and supply</h1>
                    <p>If we focus only on load shifting, demand response is constrained by the fact that there is a 
					limited potential for shifting load to a ‘better’ time. However, the main goal of demand response 
					is making the best use of available resources, rather than load shifting or curtailment. In fact, 
					demand response can be regarded as a solar and wind balancing mechanism.</p>
					<p>Under this perspective, demand response is related to coordinating the capabilities 
					of neighboring building blocks. The heterogeneity in capabilities makes this coordination challenging, but it is necessary 
					for achieving a high level of sufficiency or flexibility. The ability of micro-generation and storage 
					enabled buildings to contribute – through aggregation – to demand response is a key enabler so that 
					multiple homes can provide energy services when they are needed. Heat pumps can provide electricity 
					demand reduction, even more when combined with thermal storage. Micro combined heat and power (Micro-CHP) 
					can provide additional generation capacity at peak times and solar PV with storage can store electricity 
					when generation is high but demand low, for use when system demand peaks either to export or for self 
					consumption.</p>
					<p>Model predictive control (MPC) refers to a class of control algorithms that utilise an internal 
					model to predict the future response of a process. At each control interval, an MPC algorithm 
					optimises the future process behaviour by computing a sequence of future inputs.</p>

                    <h1>How can energy efficiency improvements be fostered?</h1>
                    <p>Let’s start with the basics: If we wanted to build a solution that supports energy consumers to become more energy efficient, what should our primary goal be?</p> 
					<div id="list2">
					   <ul>
						  <li><p><em>Is providing energy consumers with more information about their energy consumption enough?</em>We already know that detailed feedback on electricity consumption that provides real-time or 
					near real-time information, enables consumers to save energy through reduced waste. But <u>how</u> the 
					feedback is provided, the way consumers perceive this information, whether they believe that they are 
					capable of making a difference and whether they are motivated to take action are the really critical issues.</p></li>
						  <li><p><em>Should consumers devote time and energy to be more responsive to the grid’s needs?</em>
							A person that uses his/her 
					car to drive from place A to place B does not and should not care about the fact that the car is full 
					of microprocessors that make operational decisions – at a speed that is much faster than the driver’s 
					reaction time – regarding aspects that support but do not interfere with the transport service 
					provided. This is a good analogy for demand response; consumers need specific services 
					(e.g. lighting or heating) and all aspects of optimizing shiftable loads should take place under the 
					hood. In other words, demand response should be as automated as possible. But we should not confuse energy efficiency with demand response. 
					The aim of energy efficiency is to support the same level of energy service either 
					with less energy consumption or from renewable energy sources.</p></li>
						  <li><p><em>What is really needed for consumer engagement in energy efficiency?</em>In contrast with demand response, 
					energy efficiency improvements require conscious decisions and agency. Agency is created when people 
					believe that their contribution is important, know what to do and decide for themselves to do it. 
					Furthermore, efficiency-related decisions are mainly investment decisions. Motivating and supporting consumer behavioral change to achieve greater energy efficiency requires 
					providing an intrinsic value to energy efficiency, as well as providing awareness of the existence of 
					alternative options to improve it when the corresponding windows of investment opportunity materialize.</p></li>
					   </ul>
					</div>
					<p>Coming back to the original question, our primary goal should be to empower consumers to pursuit energy 
					efficiency improvements. Consumers feel empowered if they can pursuit a goal that is aligned with their 
					perceptions of personal and community level welfare, quality of life and responsibility, as well as if 
					they are supported to achieve <u>gradual and persistent</u> changes in their energy consumption profile.</p>

                    <h1>Roadmapping and Participatory Model Building</h1>
                    <p>Polytely organises and implements workshops, during which the participants engage in a participatory 
					roadmapping process that aims to identify strategic pathways and opportunities for collaboration and innovation. 
					The roadmapping process facilitates the exchange of local or sectoral knowledge and experience, and highlights 
					opportunities for and challenges of collaboration between the involved stakeholders. It is also expected that 
					opportunities for collaboration will emerge through the identification of the conditions under which 
					stakeholders’ collaboration could increase their capability to affect the future rather than submit to it. </p>
					<p>The main purpose of this process is not to come up with scenarios; the process’s goal is to identify 
					patterns of potential collaboration or conflict between the stakeholders. The main question for the 
					participants under a given scenario is:</p>
					<p class="tab" style="color:#200000">Given your expectations of your (i.e. the stakeholders you represent) and the other stakeholders’ 
					actions under this scenario, what would be the benefit of collaboration, around which technology and/or 
					service could this collaboration materialise, and what measures should be implemented – in terms of 
					learning, experimenting or risk sharing – so that collaboration to be viable?</p>
					<p>The participatory roadmapping process:<p>
					<div id="list1">
					   <ol>
						  <li><p><em>Brings forth the knowledge and concerns of the stakeholders.</em>This entails the use of methods that are 
							appropriate when: i) one wants to explore the stakeholders’ perceptions and probable actions under 
							different conditions, and ii) the problems at hand are complex, involve many parties, and have no easy 
							solutions or right answers.</p></li>
						  <li><p><em>Adopts a ‘stakeholder based’ approach that views the future system under study as the outcome of the interactions of the stakeholders who operate within it.</em>
							Under this perspective, the future of a system can be considered as resulting – at least to a 
							significant extent – from the development of balance of power between the involved stakeholders. 
							This entails putting considerable emphasis on exploring the dynamics and possibilities of 
							interactions through a guided discussion between all relevant stakeholders, during which 
							participants can influence each other, and change views.</p></li>
						  <li><p><em>Facilitates the exchange of knowledge and experience.</em>A central premise of our approach is that 
						  different actors perceive the same system in their own subjective ways, through the lenses of their interests 
						  and the attributes of their day-to-day experience. As a result, one can elicit a set of different narratives that 
						  describe the system and its dynamics, each one having different levels of detail, scale, emphasis and boundaries 
						  than the actual system. Helping someone to view the ‘world’ with a different mental map is an important aspect of 
						  knowledge exchange. Quoting Rebecca Solnit in <i>Infinite City</i>: <span style="color: #505050">"An atlas may represent many places in the same 
						  way or the same place in many ways, and it is in the myriad of descriptions that the maps begin to approximate the 
						  rich complexity of the place, of a place, of any place.”</span></p></li>
						  <li><p><em>Highlights opportunities for and challenges of collaboration between the involved stakeholders.</em>By 
							organizing stakeholders in a tightly orchestrated process, opportunities for collaboration emerge through the identification of 
							the conditions under which stakeholders’ collaboration could increase their capability to affect the future rather than 
							submit to it.</p></li>

					<div class="media-body"><p class="media-heading">The outcome of this process is a shared – among the 
					participating stakeholders – map of interrelations and links that connect stakeholders around services or 
					technologies. Depending of the details of the methodology and its adaptation each time, these maps can 
					exist in software, in printed handouts filled in by the participants or even photos of graphs and diagrams 
					in a room with full-wall whiteboards.</p>
