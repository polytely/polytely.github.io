                    <h1>How can energy efficiency improvements be fostered?</h1>
                    <p>Let’s start with the basics: If we wanted to build a solution that supports energy consumers to become more energy efficient, what should our primary goal be?</p> 
					<p class="wonder">&nbsp;&nbsp;Do consumers need more information about their energy consumption?</p>
					<p class="tab">We already know that detailed feedback on electricity consumption that provides real-time or 
					near real-time information, enables consumers to save energy through reduced waste. But <u>how</u> the 
					feedback is provided, the way consumers perceive this information, whether they believe that they are 
					capable of making a difference and whether they are motivated to take action are the really critical issues.</p>
					<p class="wonder">&nbsp;&nbsp;Should consumers devote time and energy to be more responsive to the grid’s needs?</p>
					<p class="tab"> A person that uses his/her 
					car to drive from place A to place B does not and should not care about the fact that the car is full 
					of microprocessors that make operational decisions – at a speed that is much faster than the driver’s 
					reaction time – regarding aspects that support but do not interfere with the transport service 
					provided.</p>
					<p class="tab">This is a good analogy for demand response; consumers need specific services 
					(e.g. lighting or heating) and all aspects of optimizing shiftable loads should take place under the 
					hood. In other words, demand response should be as automated as possible. But we should not confuse energy efficiency with demand response. </p>
					<p class="wonder">&nbsp;&nbsp;What is really needed for energy efficiency?</p>
					<p class="tab">The aim of energy efficiency is to support the same level of energy service either 
					with less energy consumption or from renewable energy sources. In contrast with demand response, 
					energy efficiency improvements require conscious decisions and agency. Agency is created when people 
					believe that their contribution is important, know what to do and decide for themselves to do it. 
					Furthermore, efficiency-related decisions are mainly investment decisions.</p>
					<p class="tab">Motivating and supporting 
					consumers’ behavioral change to achieve greater energy efficiency requires 
					providing an intrinsic value to energy efficiency, as well as providing awareness of the existence of 
					alternative options to improve it when the corresponding windows of investment opportunity materialize.</p>
					<p>Coming back to the original question, our primary goal should be to empower consumers to pursuit energy 
					efficiency improvements. Consumers feel empowered if they can pursuit a goal that is aligned with their 
					perceptions of personal and community level welfare, quality of life and responsibility, as well as if 
					they are supported to achieve <u>gradual and persistent</u> changes in their energy consumption profile.</p>

                    <h1>The role of data analytics in creating energy efficiency services</h1>
                    <p>Big Data is a term consistently found in articles and solutions concerning energy efficiency, 
					the premise being that smart meters – and smart grids in general – are able to collect and make 
					available large volumes of data, the analysis of which can help identify relationships that 
					were previously unnoticed, improve predictability and facilitate new services of information 
					provision. Although this premise is generally true, it helps if we have already defined the questions that our 
					data analytics algorithms should be able to address. In Polytely, we are focusing on two challenges 
					that are critical, according to our way of perceiving the energy efficiency services to provide.</p>
					<p>The first challenge is to extract of set of recurring patterns in a stream 
					of energy consumption data from a large number of households, so as to perform <u>meaningful</u> 
					clustering of these households. Contrary to the aggregated load curves which are characterized by their seasonality,
					regularity and sensitivity to meteorological conditions, household load curves are very volatile, 
					their shape depends mainly on the consumer behaviour and are less dependent on weather conditions. 
					Consequently, our focus is on identifying and exploiting common consumption behaviour patterns in 
					a load profiles stream.</p>
					<div class="media">
					<a class="pull-left" href="styles/profile.png">
					<img class="thumbnail" src="styles/profile.png" alt="Consumption profile" style="height:200px;">
					</a>
					<div class="media-body"><p class="media-heading">In reality, this is a feature extraction problem and in this context 
					meaningful clustering implies the ability to associate recurring patterns in consumption with actual 
					practices in the consumers's daily routines. Intelligent efficiency is largely based on the premise that 
					clustering by recurrent patterns will lead to results that are significantly similar to the actual 
					segmentation of the consumers based on their habits and characteristics.</p>
					</div>
					</div>
					<p>The second challenge concerns the estimation of the willingness or capability of the consumers to 
					adapt their consumption profiles in response to external recommendations. One way to approach this 
					issue is as if each consumer can be represented by one model that generates a load profile segment 
					based on the load profile segment’s class during the previous time interval and by another model that 
					generates deviations in this load profile as a response to a recommendation received.</p>
					<p>Both challenges must be addressed if one wants to 'translate' the information gathered into actual 
					guidance provision towards energy efficiency goals.</p>

                    <h1>Real time coordination of energy demand, storage and supply</h1>
                    <p>If we focus only on load shifting, demand response is constrained by the fact that there is a 
					limited potential for shifting load to a ‘better’ time. However, the main goal of demand response 
					is making the best use of available resources, rather than load shifting or curtailment. In fact, 
					demand response can be regarded as a solar and wind balancing mechanism.</p>
					<p>Under this perspective, demand response is related to coordinating the capabilities 
					of neighboring building blocks. The heterogeneity in capabilities makes this coordination challenging, but it is necessary 
					for achieving a high level of sufficiency or flexibility. The ability of micro-generation and storage 
					enabled buildings to contribute – through aggregation – to demand response is a key enabler so that 
					multiple homes can provide energy services when they are needed. Heat pumps can provide electricity 
					demand reduction, even more when combined with thermal storage. Micro combined heat and power (Micro-CHP) 
					can provide additional generation capacity at peak times and solar PV with storage can store electricity 
					when generation is high but demand low, for use when system demand peaks either to export or for self 
					consumption.</p>
					<p>Model predictive control (MPC) refers to a class of control algorithms that utilise an internal 
					model to predict the future response of a process. At each control interval, an MPC algorithm 
					optimises the future process behaviour by computing a sequence of future inputs.</p>

					<div class="media-body"><p class="media-heading">We are exploring 
					ways to combine MPC schemes with machine learning, since machine learning algorithms can identify 
					the important features in the data and then feed them into an MPC scheme.</p>
